= Application Logging with Kabanero on OKD with Elasticsearch, FluentD, and Kibana

__The following guide has been tested with OKD 4.2/Kabanero 0.3.0.__


Pod processes running in Kubernetes frequently produce logs. To effectively manage this log data and ensure no loss of log data occurs when a pod terminates, a log aggregation tool should be deployed on the Kubernetes cluster. Log aggregation tools help users persist, search, and visualize the log data that is gathered from the pods across the cluster. Log aggregation tools in the market today include:  EFK, LogDNA, Splunk, Datadog, IBM Operations Analytics, etc.  When considering log aggregation tools, enterprises will make choices that are inclusive of their journey to cloud, both new cloud native applications running in Kubernetes and their existing traditional IT choices.

One choice for application logging with log aggregation, based on open source, is **EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana)**. This guide describes the process of deploying EFK using the Elasticsearch Operator and the Cluster Logging Operator introduced in OCP 4.1. Use this preconfigured EFK stack to aggregate all container logs. After a successful installation, the EFK pods should reside inside the *openshift-logging* namespace of the OCP cluster.

== Install cluster logging

To install the cluster logging component, follow the Openshift guide https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/logging/cluster-logging-deploying.html[Deploying cluster logging]

After the installation completes without any error, you can see the following pods that are running in the *openshift-logging* namespace. The exact number of pods running for each of the EFK components can vary depending on the configuration specified in the ClusterLogging Custom Resource (CR).

[root@rhel7-ocp ~]# oc get pods -n openshift-logging

The cluster logging also exposes a route for external access to the Kibana console.

[root@rhel7-okd ~]# oc get routes -n openshift-logging

== Configure Fluentd to merge JSON log message body

If there are application pods outputting logs in JSON format, then it is recommended to set Fluentd to parse the JSON fields from the message body and merge the parsed objects with the JSON payload document posted to Elasticsearch.

This feature is disabled by default. To enable this feature, first set the cluster logging instance's **managementState** field from **"Managed"** to **"Unmanaged"**. Setting the cluster logging instance to unmanaged state gives the administrator full control of the components managed by the Cluster Logging Operator, and is the prerequisites for many cluster logging configurations

[source,role="no_copy"]
----
[root@rhel7-ocp ~]# oc edit ClusterLogging instance

apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "ClusterLogging"
metadata:
  name: "instance"

....

spec:
  managementState: "Unmanaged"
----

Then, set the environment variable **MERGE_JSON_LOG** to **true** with the following command:

[source,role="no_copy"]
----
[root@rhel7-ocp ~]# oc set env ds/fluentd MERGE_JSON_LOG=true
----
== View application logs in Kibana

In cases where the application server provides the option, output application logs in JSON format.  This will let you fully take advantage of Kibana's dashboard functions. Kibana is then able to process the data from each individual field of the JSON object to create customized visualizations for that field.

See the Kibana dashboard page by using the routes URL https://kibana-openshift-logging.apps.host.kabanero.com. Log in using your OKD user and password, then the browser should redirect you to Kibana's **Discover** page where the newest logs of the selected index are being streamed. Select the **project.\*** index to view the application logs generated by the deployed application.

*Figure 2: Kibana page showing application log entries*

The **project.*** index contains only a set of default fields at the start, which does not include all of the fields from the deployed application's JSON log object. Therefore, the index needs to be refreshed to have all the fields from the application's log object available to Kibana.

To refresh the index, click on the **Management** option on the left pane.

Click **Index Pattern**, and find the **project.pass:[*]**  index in Index Pattern. Then, click the refresh fields button, which is on the right. After Kibana is updated with all the available fields in the **project.pass:[*]** index, import any preconfigured dashboards to view the application's logs.

To import the dashboard and its associated objects, navigate back to the **Management** page and click **Saved Objects**. Click **Import** and select the dashboard file. When prompted, click the **Yes, overwrite all** option

Head back to the **Dashboard** page and enjoy navigating logs on the newly imported dashboard.

== Configuring and uninstalling cluster logging

If changes need to be made for the installed EFK stack, edit the ClusterLogging Custom Resource (CR) of the deployed cluster logging instance. Make sure to set the managementState to **"Unmanaged"** first before making any changes to the existing configuration. If the EFK stack is no longer needed, remove the cluster logging instance from Cluster Logging Operator Details page.
